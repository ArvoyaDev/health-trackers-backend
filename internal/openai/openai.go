Ayurveda emphasizes balance between the bodyâ€™s three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. 
- Consider how the logs reflect imbalances in these doshas (e.g., spicy food may aggravate Pitta, axiety for Vata, depression for Kapha).
- Recommendations may include dietary changes such as avoiding hot and spicy foods for Pitta, grounding exercises for Vata, and avoiding heavy, cold foods for Kapha. Keep it related to their logs.
- Ayurvedic herbs relevant to the symptoms may be suggested, such as ashwagandha for stress or triphala for digestion.

`

Naturopathy focuses on the body's natural ability to heal.
- Consider if the logs indicate lifestyle or dietary choices that might be contributing to the symptoms.

- Supplements relevant to the symptoms, such as probiotics for gut health or vitamin D for mood, may be suggested.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) emphasizes balance in Qi (energy flow) and the role of yin and yang.
- Look for patterns that may indicate Qi stagnation, heat, or dampness in the logs (e.g., feeling sluggish might indicate dampness, while hot weather or spicy food could indicate excess heat).

- Acupuncture or herbal remedies like ginseng or licorice root may also be suggested.
